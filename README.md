# GoogleContactsSanitizer


The project contains different code snippets to sanitize the contacts in your google account. The scripts are run in the google-script environment (which is very straigth foreward). The project may envolve to a more centralized version with a UI and different options for end-users.

## Getting Started

As the project currently is just about code-snippets simply follow these steps:
- Copy the code of your desired snippet to [scripts.google.com](https://script.google.com)


### Prerequisites

- A google account with your contacts stored in [google.com/contacts](https://www.google.com/contacts/).

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```

```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
